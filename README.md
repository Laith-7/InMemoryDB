# InMemoryDB

-Steps to properly setup and run the code: 
1. Clone the repository, for example using: git clone <repository-url>
2. Navigate to the project directory on your terminal
3. Compile and run the code as needed using commands such as: javac Main.java && java Main


Please keep in mind that there is a main function already in place to test the code, please change as you like. 


- Suggestions for future enhancements for this assignment:
1. Possibly include examples of additional edge cases, such as nested transactions; allow multiple levels of transactions. 
2. Test additonal scenarious like duplicate keys in transactions
3. Be more specific on the expections of the submission - wasn't sure if we were supposed to keep our main in the submission
4. Building on the last, maybe adding an autograder of some sort that runs cases to test functionality of our code could be less confusing.
